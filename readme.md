# **C Base Calculator**

This is a simple base calculator I made for CSCI304 in Spring 2024.
It takes user input as **Binary, Decimal, Octal, or Hex** and can convert between them.
It can also do simple operations like:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Negation
- Complement
- Bitwise OR
- Bitwise XOR
- Bitwise AND
- Left and Right Shifts

## Compilation and Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-base-calculator.git
cd c-base-calculator
gcc calc.c -o calc
./calc
```

This was my first real project in C and I am still happy with it over a year-and-a-half later. It was a great starting point with the language and learning its specifics
